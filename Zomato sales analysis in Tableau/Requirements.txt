The analysis utilizes test data provided by Zomato, contained within `Zomato data.zip`.
**Specific Tables Used for Sales Analysis:**
* `orders.csv`: Contains transaction-level data including order details, timestamps, and amounts.
* `restaurant.csv`: Contains information about the restaurants listed on the platform.
* `users.csv`: Contains information about registered users/customers.

*(Note: Data joining and transformation may be required based on analysis needs.)* Created left joins in correct columns to join data tables.

## 4. Project Stages & Tasks

This project follows a two-stage process common in BI workflows:

**Stage 1: Decomposition (Planning)**
* **Task:** Develop a detailed research plan outlining:
    * Specific research questions related to sales performance.
    * Hypotheses to be tested.
    * Key metrics and KPIs to track (e.g., Total Sales, Average Order Value, Sales Growth Rate, Sales by Restaurant/Region/Time).
    * Required data preparation and transformation steps.
    * Preliminary ideas for dashboard visualizations.
* **Deliverable:** Decomposition Plan Document.
* **Approval:** Requires review and acceptance by the Team Lead.

**Stage 2: Execution (Analysis, Dashboarding, Reporting)**
* **Task:** Execute the approved research plan:
    * Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
    * Conduct in-depth sales analysis using appropriate statistical methods and tools.
    * Develop an interactive dashboard (using Tableau Public or Power BI) to visually represent key findings and tell a compelling story about sales performance.
    * Synthesize findings into a comprehensive report.
* **Deliverables:**
    1.  Interactive Dashboard (link to Tableau Public or deployed Power BI report).
    2.  Final Report/Presentation (e.g., PDF, DOCX, PPTX) including:
        * Summary of Analysis.
        * Key Findings & Insights.
        * Actionable Conclusions & Business Recommendations.
* **Approval:** Requires review and acceptance of the Dashboard and Report by the Team Lead.
