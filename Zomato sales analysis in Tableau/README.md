## Project Overview

Welcome to my final project for the Zomato junior analyst onboarding! This project dives deep into **Sales Analysis** using Zomato's test datasets. My goal was to explore key sales metrics, identify trends over time, understand customer purchasing behaviors from a sales perspective, and ultimately, provide actionable insights and recommendations to help Zomato boost its business.

## My Role

For this project, I acted as a **Junior Analyst** at Zomato, tackling a real-world business problem as part of my onboarding.

## The Business Problem

Zomato, a global food delivery and restaurant aggregator, provided a set of test datasets for business performance analysis. As my first assignment, I chose to focus on **Sales Analysis** among the three available areas (Customer, Restaurant, Sales). The objective was to research this area thoroughly and present my findings through a dashboard and a comprehensive report.

## My Research Area: Sales Analysis

My investigation centered on the following core questions:

* How have sales and revenue evolved over time?
* Are there changes in sales distribution (e.g., quarterly, seasonally)?
* Which customer segments are driving the most sales, and how can Zomato expand its reach to other customer bases?
* Are there patterns of profit losses or inconsistencies between costs and sales?
* Do certain locations or areas perform better in terms of overall sales?

## Data Utilized

For this analysis, I leveraged the following tables from the provided `Zomato data.zip` archive:

* `restaurant`
* `users`
* `orders`

*(While `food` and `menu` tables were part of the archive, they were not the primary focus for this specific sales analysis, aligning with my decomposition plan.)*

## Dashboard & Visualizations

My dashboard was designed to tell a clear story about Zomato's sales performance, incorporating time-based trends, geographical insights, customer demographics, and financial indicators.

### Key Visualizations:

* **Sales Over Time (Line Chart):** Illustrating annual and quarterly revenue trends.
* **Geographical Sales Performance (Map):** Highlighting sales performance across different locations.
* **Profit & Loss Analysis (Graph):** Examining financial trends related to sales.
* **Customer Spending by Demographics (Bar Chart):** Identifying which customer segments contribute most to sales.

The overall aim was to visualize trends within the sales data that could inform future advertising campaigns, sales boosts, targeted demographic outreach, and understanding seasonal purchasing behaviors.

## Key Findings & Recommendations (from My Project Report)

### 1. Sales Dynamics Over Time

* **Insight:** Zomato experienced a significant sales increase in 2017, leading to record sales in 2018. However, a decline started in Q2 of 2019. Q1 and Q4 consistently show higher sales compared to Q2 and Q3.
* **Recommendation:** Implement targeted ads and promotions during Q2 and Q3 to stimulate customer engagement. Investigate the factors contributing to stronger sales in Q1 and Q4 to replicate successful strategies throughout the year.

### 2. Customer Engagement & Ratings

* **Insight:** Most customer ratings fall between 3 and 4.5 out of 5, indicating a solid base for customer satisfaction. Interestingly, higher sales volumes or larger purchases correlate with a greater likelihood of customers leaving a review.
* **Recommendation:** Launch a focused review campaign to encourage more customer feedback. Consider developing incentives for reviews or special offers for repeat customers to build loyalty.

### 3. Cost Inconsistencies vs. Sales

* **Insight:** Costs are inconsistent across different restaurants, and higher spending doesn't always translate to higher sales.
* **Recommendation:** A deeper dive into the relationship between operational spending and revenue generated by individual restaurants is needed to identify areas for optimizing costs or strategic investment.

### 4. Customer Demographics & Spending Patterns

* **Insight:** Spending between men and women is relatively similar. However, "Single, no income" individuals are by far the top customers, representing a significant portion of overall sales.
* **Recommendation:** Further analyze the motivations and needs of the "Single, no income" customer base. Develop strategies to attract and grow customer segments in other demographics, such as married individuals and various income levels, to significantly expand Zomato's sales.

## Conclusion

Zomato has substantial opportunities for growth, not only in overall sales but also in improving customer ratings. By implementing targeted incentives for reviews, strategic promotions for repeat customers, and by effectively engaging married individuals and income earners across all categories, Zomato can achieve exponential sales growth across its entire restaurant network.

* **Microsoft Word / Google Docs:** Used for compiling the detailed project report and findings.
* **Discord:** Essential for communication with my team leader and peers.
* **Zomato Test Data (CSV files):** The raw datasets provided for analysis.
