**Project Status:** Completed 04/2025
**Last Updated:** April 9, 2025 

## Project Overview

This repository contains my capstone project for the TripleTen Business Intelligence Analyst program. It showcases an end-to-end BI analysis process, simulating a real-world task for a Junior BI Analyst at Zomato, a global restaurant aggregator and food delivery service.

The primary goal was to analyze historical sales data to identify key performance trends, uncover actionable insights, and develop data-driven recommendations aimed at enhancing Zomato's sales strategies and overall business performance.

## Analysis Focus: Sales Performance

This analysis concentrated specifically on **Sales Performance**, addressing questions such as:
* What are the key sales trends over time?
* Which Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) best measure sales success (e.g., Total Revenue, Average Order Value, Growth Rates)?
* How do sales vary across different dimensions (e.g., time periods, restaurant attributes)?
* What factors correlate with higher sales performance?

## Key Objectives

* Perform data cleaning, transformation, and validation on provided datasets (`orders`, `restaurant`, `users`).
* Conduct Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand underlying patterns.
* Develop relevant KPIs and metrics to track sales performance.
* Create insightful visualizations and an interactive dashboard to communicate findings effectively.
* Derive actionable conclusions and provide strategic recommendations based on the analysis.

## Tools & Technologies Utilized

* **Data Manipulation & Analysis:** SQL, Python (Pandas, NumPy)
* **Data Visualization & Dashboarding:** [Choose One: Tableau Public OR Power BI]
* **Version Control:** Git / GitHub
* **Project Management & Communication:** Agile principles (decomposition planning), simulated stakeholder communication (Discord).

## Methodology

1.  **Decomposition & Planning:** Defined clear research questions, hypotheses, KPIs, and an analysis plan.
2.  **Data Preparation:** Cleaned, merged, and transformed data from multiple sources (`orders`, `restaurant`, `users`) using Tableau table joins and relationships.
3.  **Exploratory & In-depth Analysis:** Investigated sales trends, calculated KPIs, and segmented data to uncover patterns.
4.  **Dashboard Development:** Built an interactive dashboard in Tableau Public visualizing key sales insights and trends.
5.  **Reporting & Recommendations:** Compiled findings and formulated actionable business recommendations in a final report.
