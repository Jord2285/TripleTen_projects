# Project Title: E-commerce User Activity Analysis: Conversion Funnel & Cohort Retention

## 1. Introduction & Context

**Project Source:** Business Analytics Curriculum Project
**Scenario:** This project simulates the responsibilities of a newly hired Junior Analyst at an e-commerce company. The core task is to analyze raw user activity logs generated by the company's website.
**Objective:** Utilize spreadsheet software (Google Sheets) to transform raw event data into meaningful business metrics, specifically focusing on website conversion performance and customer retention patterns.

## 2. Business Problem & Objectives

**Business Need:** The company needs to understand how effectively users navigate the website from viewing products to making purchases (conversion) and how well the platform retains customers over time after their initial purchase (retention).
**Project Objectives:**
* Construct a multi-stage conversion funnel (view -> cart -> purchase) using unique user counts per stage.
* Calculate overall and step-by-step conversion rates through the funnel.
* Prepare the raw data for cohort analysis by isolating purchase events and identifying each user's first purchase month.
* Calculate monthly cohort retention rates based on the month of the user's first purchase.
* Present the analysis, methodology, and findings in a professionally organized and documented spreadsheet report.

## 3. Data Source

* **Dataset:** `raw_user_activity` data provided within a Google Sheet.
* **Structure:** Each row represents a single user event (activity) on the website.
* **Key Columns:**
    * `user_id`: Unique customer identifier.
    * `event_type`: Type of user activity (e.g., 'view', 'cart', 'purchase').
    * `category_code`: Product category.
    * `brand`: Product brand.
    * `price`: Product price (USD).
    * `event_date`: Date of the activity (YYYY-MM-DD format).

## 4. Key Analytical Tasks (Using Google Sheets)

The project involves several distinct analysis and data preparation steps organized into parts:

**Part 1: Conversion Funnel Construction**
1.  Create a Pivot Table (`conversion_funnel` sheet) based on `raw_user_activity`.
2.  Configure the Pivot Table to count unique `user_id`s for each relevant `event_type` (implicitly view, cart, purchase) forming the funnel stages.
3.  Add columns to calculate:
    * Total conversion rate (e.g., unique purchasers / unique viewers).
    * Step-by-step conversion rates (e.g., unique cart users / unique viewers; unique purchasers / unique cart users).

**Part 2: Cohort Analysis Data Preparation**
1.  Filter the `raw_user_activity` data to isolate only 'purchase' events. Copy these filtered rows to a new sheet named `purchase_activity`.
2.  Determine the first purchase date for each user:
    * Create a Pivot Table (`first_purchase` sheet) on `purchase_activity` to find the `MIN(event_date)` for each `user_id`.
    * Add a `first_purchase_date` column to the `purchase_activity` sheet, populating it using `VLOOKUP()` referencing the `first_purchase` sheet.
3.  Add helper columns to `purchase_activity` for monthly cohort tracking:
    * `event_month`: Format `event_date` as 'YYYY-MM' using `TEXT()`.
    * `first_purchase_month`: Format `first_purchase_date` as 'YYYY-MM' using `TEXT()`.
    * `cohort_age`: Calculate the difference in months between `first_purchase_month` and `event_month` using `DATEDIF()` (Resulting in ages 0-4 months).

**Part 3: Retention Rate Calculation**
1.  Create a Pivot Table (`cohort_analysis` sheet) using the prepared `purchase_activity` data.
    * Rows: `first_purchase_month` (representing the acquisition cohort).
    * Columns: `cohort_age` (months 0 through 4).
    * Values: Count of unique `user_id`s.
2.  Create a final `retention_rates` sheet.
    * Manually structure a table with cohorts (first purchase months) as rows and cohort ages (1 through 4) as columns.
    * Calculate the retention rate for each cell: (Unique users active in that cohort month) / (Total unique users in the cohort's initial month - age 0). Use appropriate cell referencing (e.g., fixed column for initial size).

**Part 4: Spreadsheet Organization & Documentation**
1.  Complete the "Executive Summary" sheet, summarizing results and detailing the analysis approach, data used, assumptions, and key decisions.
2.  Complete the "Table of Contents" sheet.
3.  Organize all spreadsheet tabs logically (e.g., Summary, TOC, Results, Calculations, Data).
4.  Apply professional formatting throughout the spreadsheet (number/date formats, borders, headers, frozen panes, etc.) for readability.
5.  Ensure the Google Sheet is shared correctly (view-only access for anyone with the link).

## 5. Tools & Techniques

* **Primary Tool:** Google Sheets
* **Key Techniques:**
    * Data Filtering
    * Pivot Tables (including unique count aggregation)
    * Spreadsheet Functions: `VLOOKUP`, `TEXT`, `DATEDIF`, standard arithmetic operations.
    * Data Structuring for time-based analysis (funnels, cohorts).
    * Spreadsheet Formatting and Best Practices for Readability.
    * Report Documentation (Executive Summary, TOC).

## 6. Deliverables

* A single, well-organized, and fully documented Google Sheets file containing:
    * All analysis results (`conversion_funnel`, `retention_rates`).
    * All supporting calculations and data preparation steps (`cohort_analysis`, `purchase_activity`, `first_purchase`).
    * Comprehensive documentation (`Executive Summary`, `Table of Contents`).
    * The original `raw_user_activity` data.

## 7. Assessment Criteria (Summary)

* Accuracy of conversion funnel metrics and retention rate calculations.
* Correctness of data preparation steps using filters, Pivot Tables, and functions.
* Clarity, completeness, and professionalism of the spreadsheet organization and documentation (including Executive Summary and formatting).
* Adherence to all project instructions and best practices in spreadsheet analysis.
