---

**Project Status:** Completed 01/2025
**Last Updated:** April 9, 2025

## Project Overview

This repository contains a business intelligence project completed during the TripleTen program, demonstrating proficiency in spreadsheet-based data analysis. In a simulated consulting engagement, I analyzed NYC Airbnb data to provide data-driven recommendations to a client seeking guidance on vacation rental investments in Manhattan.

The core objective was to identify the most attractive neighborhoods and property sizes based on market demand (proxied by review frequency) and estimate the potential revenue for targeted investment opportunities.

## Key Objectives

* Identify the Top 10 most attractive Manhattan neighborhoods for Airbnb rentals using review data.
* Determine the most popular property sizes (by bedroom count) overall and within top neighborhoods.
* Define criteria for 'Top Listings' based on optimal neighborhood/size combinations.
* Calculate potential 30-day and estimated annual revenue for these 'Top Listings'.
* Deliver actionable investment recommendations supported by data, presented clearly within a spreadsheet format.

## Analysis Focus Areas

* Neighborhood Attractiveness (based on review volume)
* Property Size Popularity
* Revenue Potential Estimation for Optimized Listings

## Tools & Technologies Utilized

* **Primary Software:** Spreadsheet Application (Google Sheets)
* **Key Techniques:**
    * Data Cleaning & Standardization
    * Advanced Pivot Table Analysis
    * Spreadsheet Functions (`IF`, `SUMIF`)
    * Data Visualization (Bar Charts within spreadsheet)
    * Financial Estimation (30-day and Annualized Revenue)
    * Structured Reporting & Documentation within the spreadsheet

## Methodology

1.  **Data Preparation:** Cleaned and validated raw Airbnb data (listings and calendar), specifically standardizing neighborhood names and handling bedroom count variations (including studios). Documented all cleaning steps.
2.  **Attractiveness Analysis:** Leveraged Pivot Tables and `number_of_reviews_ltm` to rank neighborhoods and identify popular property sizes, including analyzing preferences within the top-ranked neighborhoods.
3.  **Revenue Calculation & Ranking:** Defined 'Top Listings' based on location/size criteria. Used `SUMIF` to aggregate potential 30-day revenue from calendar data (based on `adjusted_price` and availability). Ranked these listings and estimated annual revenue potential.
4.  **Reporting:** Synthesized all analysis, findings, visualizations, and recommendations into a single, well-structured, and clearly documented spreadsheet deliverable.

## Project Deliverables

* **Comprehensive Analysis Spreadsheet:** (https://1drv.ms/b/c/e19f4da4f3d3fb01/EfcqieXWlM5Bnt6ugFeXTskBxjE34_s7cTGj4uBUSWHw6w?e=BXUcG4)]

## Key Findings & Impact (Example - Tailor to your specific results)

The analysis pinpointed specific high-demand neighborhood and property-size combinations (e.g., 1-bedroom apartments in [Top Neighborhood X]) and provided estimated revenue figures, offering the client concrete, data-backed targets for potential investment evaluation.
