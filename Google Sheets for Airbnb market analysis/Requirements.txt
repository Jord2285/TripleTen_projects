# Project Title: NYC Airbnb Market Analysis for Vacation Rental Investment

## 1. Introduction & Context

**Project Source:** TripleTen Sprint Project (Spreadsheet Data Analysis)
**Scenario:** This project simulates a consulting engagement where a client seeks guidance on investing in the Manhattan vacation rental market.
**Objective:** Analyze provided NYC Airbnb data using spreadsheet software to identify the most promising neighborhoods and property types for investment, based on attractiveness and potential revenue.

## 2. Business Problem & Objectives

**Client Need:** Understand which types of Airbnb listings (based on location and size) in Manhattan offer the best potential return on investment.
**Project Objectives:**
* Identify the most attractive neighborhoods for vacation rentals using review frequency (`number_of_reviews_ltm`) as a proxy for demand.
* Determine the most popular property sizes (number of bedrooms) overall and within the top neighborhoods.
* Estimate the potential revenue generated by listings that match the identified optimal neighborhood and property size criteria.
* Provide data-driven recommendations to guide the client's investment strategy.

## 3. Data Source

* **Dataset:** NYC Airbnb Data provided by TripleTen.
    * Implicitly includes listing details (e.g., `listings.csv` with columns like `id`, `neighbourhood`, `bedrooms`, `number_of_reviews_ltm`).
    * Implicitly includes calendar/pricing data (e.g., `calendar.csv` with columns like `listing_id`, `date`, `available`, `adjusted_price`).

## 4. Key Analytical Questions

1.  Which neighborhoods and property sizes (i.e., number of bedrooms) are most attractive for vacation rentals?
2.  How much potential revenue did the most attractive listings (based on neighborhood and size) generate?

## 5. Methodology & Core Tasks

The analysis was conducted primarily using spreadsheet software, following these steps:

1.  **Data Preparation & Cleaning:**
    * Created a copy of the raw data.
    * Cleaned the `neighborhood` column for consistency (capitalization, spaces) into `neighborhood_clean`.
    * Cleaned the `bedrooms` column, treating empty cells as studios (0 bedrooms), into `bedrooms_clean` using the `IF` function.
    * Documented all cleaning steps in a separate change log sheet.
2.  **Attractiveness Analysis (using Pivot Tables):**
    * Identified the Top 10 most attractive neighborhoods based on the sum of `number_of_reviews_ltm`.
    * Visualized the Top 10 neighborhoods' review counts with a Bar Chart.
    * Determined the most popular property sizes (bedroom count) based on review counts.
    * Analyzed property size preferences *within* each of the Top 10 neighborhoods.
3.  **Revenue Analysis (Focus on 'Top Listings'):**
    * Defined 'Top Listings' by creating a flag (`top_listing`) for properties located in one of the Top 10 neighborhoods *and* matching the most popular bedroom count for that specific neighborhood (Studio for Midtown, 1-Bedroom for others).
    * Calculated 30-day revenue potential:
        * Created `revenue_earned` in the calendar data (`adjusted_price` if `available` = 'f', else $0).
        * Aggregated total 30-day `revenue_earned` per listing into the listings data using `SUMIF()`.
    * Ranked 'Top Listings' based on their calculated 30-day revenue using a Pivot Table (filtered by `top_listing`=1).
    * Estimated potential annual revenue for top listings by multiplying the 30-day revenue by 12.
4.  **Documentation & Formatting:**
    * Included an Executive Summary and Table of Contents.
    * Documented key assumptions made during the analysis.
    * Ensured consistent formatting, hidden unnecessary columns, and maintained spreadsheet clarity.

## 6. Tools & Techniques

* **Primary Tool:** Spreadsheet Software (e.g., Google Sheets, Microsoft Excel)
* **Key Techniques:**
    * Data Cleaning & Transformation
    * Pivot Tables for aggregation and analysis
    * Spreadsheet Functions (`IF`, `SUMIF`)
    * Data Visualization (Bar Charts)
    * Assumption Documentation
    * Clear Formatting & Reporting within the spreadsheet

## 7. Deliverables

* A single, comprehensive spreadsheet file (`.xlsx` or Google Sheet link) containing:
    * Original (raw) data sheets.
    * Cleaned data sheets.
    * A Change Log detailing data cleaning steps.
    * All supporting Pivot Tables and data analysis addressing the key questions.
    * Visualizations (e.g., bar chart for top neighborhoods).
    * Revenue analysis and ranking for recommended listing types.
    * An Executive Summary sheet presenting key findings and investment recommendations.
    * Clear documentation of any assumptions made.

## 8. Assessment Criteria (Summary)

* Project evaluation based on the TripleTen rubric, focusing on:
    * Correct application of spreadsheet functions and Pivot Tables.
    * Accuracy of data cleaning and analysis.
    * Clarity and effectiveness of visualizations.
    * Thoroughness of documentation (cleaning steps, assumptions).
    * Professionalism of spreadsheet formatting and presentation.
    * Actionability of conclusions and recommendations.
