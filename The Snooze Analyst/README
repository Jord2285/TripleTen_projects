## Project Overview
This project, "The Snooze Analysts - Sleep and Health Impacts," was a rapid, one-week endeavor undertaken as part of the Code Pudding initiative. Our team was tasked with selecting from provided datasets, performing data cleaning and analysis, and collaboratively developing a Tableau story to explore the intricate relationship between sleep patterns and various health outcomes. The culmination of this effort was a presentation of our findings via Zoom.

## The Challenge
Within a one-week timeframe, our team aimed to:
1.  Select relevant datasets pertaining to sleep and health.
2.  Clean and prepare the data for analysis.
3.  Divide analytical tasks among team members.
4.  Individually create dashboards and visualizations.
5.  Collaboratively synthesize findings into a cohesive Tableau story.
6.  Formulate a hypothesis, draw conclusions, and suggest recommendations.
7.  Present our consolidated findings.

## My Contributions
As a member of "The Snooze Analysts," my specific responsibilities included:
* **Dashboard Development:** I was responsible for creating Tableau dashboards focusing on the relationships between:
    * Occupation and sleep patterns.
    * Stress levels and sleep metrics (quantity and quality).
    * Sleep quantity/quality and physiological measures like heart rate and blood pressure.
* **Collaborative Analysis:** I actively participated with the team in:
    * Formulating the initial hypothesis.
    * Drawing conclusions based on the collective data analysis.
    * Developing recommendations for next steps and further inquiries.
* **Tableau Story Consolidation:** I took the lead in integrating the dashboards and slides created by all team members into a single, unified Tableau story. This involved ensuring consistency in design, clarity in narrative flow, and overall project completion for the final presentation.
* **Presentation:** I presented my specific portion of the data analysis and dashboards during our team's Zoom presentation.

## Key Questions Addressed
Our analysis sought to answer questions such as:
* How do different occupations correlate with varying sleep durations and quality?
* What is the impact of stress levels on sleep quantity and perceived sleep quality?
* Is there an observable relationship between sleep metrics (duration, quality) and physiological indicators like heart rate and blood pressure?

## Technologies and Process
* **Data Cleaning & Preparation:** [e.g., Excel, Python (Pandas) - specify what was used by the team or yourself]
* **Data Analysis & Visualization:** Tableau Desktop, Tableau Public
* **Collaboration:** [e.g., Google Workspace (Docs, Sheets), Slack, Zoom]
* **Process:**
    1.  Dataset selection from provided options.
    2.  Collaborative data cleaning and preprocessing.
    3.  Division of data segments/analytical themes among team members.
    4.  Individual dashboard creation in Tableau.
    5.  Consolidation of individual work into a unified Tableau Story (led by [Your Name]).
    6.  Collaborative review, refinement of hypothesis, conclusions, and recommendations.
    7.  Final presentation via Zoom.

## Team Collaboration
This project was a testament to effective teamwork within a tight deadline. "The Snooze Analysts" – Bereket, Sakinah, and Jess – collaborated on all phases, from initial data selection and cleaning to the division of analytical tasks, hypothesis generation, and the final presentation. While individual members focused on specific data segments for dashboard creation, the synthesis of insights, conclusions, and the final Tableau story was a collective effort.
